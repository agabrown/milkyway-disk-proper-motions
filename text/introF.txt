The Sun and all the other stars in the Milky Way
disk orbit around the centre of our galaxy. This
causes the disk as a whole to rotate in a
clockwise direction as indicated by the arrow.

The following animation shows how the motions of
the stars in the disk lead to the wavy pattern we
see in the velocities at which the stars move
across the sky, as seen from the Sun.
