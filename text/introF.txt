This image shows an artist's impression of the
Milky Way disk seen from above, with the
approximate position of the Sun indicated by the
orange dot.

The wavy pattern in the speeds of the stars is
caused by the fact that the Sun and all the other
stars in the Milky Disk orbit around the centre of
our galaxy. This causes the disk as a whole to
rotate in a clockwise direction as indicated by
the arrow.

The following animation shows how the motions of
the stars in the disk lead to the wavy pattern we
see in the speeds at which the stars move across
the sky.
