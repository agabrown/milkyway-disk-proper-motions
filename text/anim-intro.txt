A schematic model of the Milky Way disk seen from
above. The Sun is the big orange dot. The other
dots represent stars orbiting around the center of
the Milky Way disk.

The animation will show the motions of the stars
as they orbit in the disk and then show how these
motions appear when seen from the sun.
