Description of the content in this video/image:

This video contains an animated infographic which explains how the wavy
pattern arises in a plot of proper motion along galactic longitude versus
galactic longitude, where the plot is made for the selection of young disk
('OBA') stars from the Gaia Collaboration paper on a golden sample of
astrophysical parameters.

The video starts out orienting the viewer with the aid of the Gaia EDR3
all-sky image of the brightness and colours of the stars. The relation with
the Milky Way disk is made and then an animation follows which shows how the
way the stars and the sun collectively revolve around the Milky Way centre
gives rise to the pattern seen in the above described plot.
